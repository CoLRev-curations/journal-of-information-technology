This will be followed by the European Conference in Information Systems, both events taking place in Cork, Ireland. The Consortium has recruited 22 students this year; they will also attend ECIS. This ® rst AIS consortium event has been generously sponsored by Andersen Consulting. Plans have already been made for a larger AIS Phd Consortium next year, to take place immediately before the ECIS conference, in France. The Journal of Information Technology has planned two forthcoming theme issues for which contributions are invited. The ® rst is entitled `IT-Enabled Collaboration and Coordination across Organizational, Geographical, Temporal and Cultural Boundaries'. The Guest Editors are Kuldeep Kumar and Han van Dissel of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. Full details of the Call for Papers appeared in the back pages of the March 1997 issue of JIT. The deadline for submission of four copies of your paper is 1 September 1997. Submissions should follow JIT guidelines and be sent to},

   title                         = {Events Theme Issues Over 300 of the European academic I.S. community attended the Fifth European Conference In Information Systems in Cork in mid-June 1997. The conference also attracted a larger number of colleagues from USA and Australasia, and hopefully this is a trend, because it greatly increases the opportunities for establishing social networks so important to mutual in¯uence and growing the IS ® eld. The ® rst AIS PHD Colloquium for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region was held in Cork immediately before the conference. It was attended by eighteen students. Sponsors were the AIS, Andersen Consulting and the Commonwealth Secretariat. The programme chairs were Leslie Willcocks and Chrisanthi Avgerou. We were fortunate to attract a large and excellent faculty of nine led by Philip Ein-Dor, Kuldeep Kumar and Geoff Walsham. The event was widely deemed a success amongst the participants and a very good esprit de corps developed during the course of the three days. Hopefully the PHD Colloquium will now be a ® rm ® xture at the front end of ECIS. The future is promising, with next year' s event already planned in conjunction with the Sixth Conference at IAE at Aix-en-Provence in France. Please note that the submission dates for paper copy submissions for ECIS 1988 is November 3rd 1997. Further details are available from Jacques-Andre Bartoli, Conference Chair, email},
